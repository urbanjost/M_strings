NAME
 upper(3f) - [M_strings:CASE] changes a string to uppercase

SYNOPSIS

    elemental pure function upper(str,begin,end) result (string)

     character(*), intent(in)    :: str
     integer,optional,intent(in) :: begin,end
     character(len(str))         :: string  ! output string
DESCRIPTION
      upper(string) returns a copy of the input string with all characters
      converted in the optionally specified range to uppercase, assuming
      ASCII character sets are being used. If no range is specified the
      entire string is converted to uppercase.

OPTIONS
    str    string to convert to uppercase
    begin  optional starting position in "str" to begin converting to uppercase
    end    optional ending position in "str" to stop converting to uppercase

RESULTS
    upper  copy of the input string with all characters converted to uppercase
           over optionally specified range.

TRIVIA
    The terms "uppercase" and "lowercase" date back to the early days of
    the mechanical printing press. Individual metal alloy casts of each
    needed letter, or punctuation symbol, were meticulously added to a
    press block, by hand, before rolling out copies of a page. These
    metal casts were stored and organized in wooden cases. The more
    often needed miniscule letters were placed closer to hand, in the
    lower cases of the work bench. The less often needed, capitalized,
    majuscule letters, ended up in the harder to reach upper cases.

EXAMPLE

    Sample program:

     program demo_upper
     use M_strings, only: upper
     implicit none
     character(len=:),allocatable  :: s
        s=' ABCDEFG abcdefg '
        write(*,*) 'mixed-case input string is ....',s
        write(*,*) 'upper-case output string is ...',upper(s)
        write(*,*) 'make first character uppercase  ... ',upper('this is a sentence.',1,1)
        write(*,'(1x,a,*(a:,"+"))') 'UPPER(3f) is elemental ==>',upper(["abc","def","ghi"])
     end program demo_upper

    Expected output

     mixed-case input string is .... ABCDEFG abcdefg
     upper-case output string is ... ABCDEFG ABCDEFG
     make first character uppercase  ... This is a sentence.
     UPPER(3f) is elemental ==>ABC+DEF+GHI
